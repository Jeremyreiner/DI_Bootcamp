# Exercise 1 : Call History
# Instructions

# Create the following methods: show_outgoing_messages(self), show_incoming_messages(self), show_messages_from(self)

# Test your code !!!
# -------------------------------
class Phone:
    # Create a class called Phone. This class takes a parameter called phone_number. 
    # When instantiating an object create an attribute called call_history which value is an empty list.
    # Add another attribute called messages to your __init__() method which value is an empty list.
    def __init__(self, phone_number):
        self.number = phone_number
        self.call_history = []
        self.messages = []

    # Add a method called call that takes both self and other_phone (i.e another Phone object) as parameters. 
    # The method should print a string stating who called who, and add this string to the phoneâ€™s call_history.
    def phone_call(self, other_phone):
        call_string= f"Call from {self.number}, to: {other_phone.number}"
        # print(call_string)
        self.call_history.append(call_string)
        other_phone.call_history.append(call_string)

    # Add a method called show_call_history. This method should print the call_history.
    def show_call_history(self):
        for record in self.call_history:
            print(f"Phone history of {self.number} is: \n{record}")

    # Create a method called send_message which is similar to the call method. 
    # Each message should be saved as a dictionary with the following keys:
    # to
    # from
    # content

            'content': content,
            }
            self.messages.append(message)
            other_phone.messages.append(message)

                print(f"Sending to: {message['to']}\nContent:{message['content']}")
                print("------END---------")
    # messege history for other number
    def show_incoming_messege(self):
        print("-----INCOMING MESSAGES----")
        for message in self.messages:
