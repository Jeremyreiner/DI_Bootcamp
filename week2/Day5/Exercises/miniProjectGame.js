// Exercise 1 : Play A Guessing Game
// Instructions
// Create a new folder on your computer.
// Clone or Download the index.html and style.css files from this github link.
// Follow the steps written below
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------
// First Part
//1.  Create a JS file and link it to the index.html file.

// 2. Take a look at your html file, you should have a button with an “onclick” event. This event is equal to the function playTheGame(). It means that when you will click on the button, the function playTheGame() will be called.
// We will learn more about events next week ;)


// Now let’s create the function:

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 3. In the JS file, create a function called playTheGame() that takes no parameter.
// In the function, start by asking the user if they would like to play the game (Hint: use the built-in confirm() function).

// If the answer is false, alert “No problem, Goodbye”.

// If his answer is true, follow these steps:
// Ask the user to enter a number between 0 and 10 (Hint: use the built-in prompt() function). You then have to check the validity of the user’s number :

// If the user didn’t enter a number (ie. if he entered another data type) alert “Sorry Not a number, Goodbye”.
// If the user didn’t enter a number between 0 and 10 alert “Sorry it’s not a good number, Goodbye”.
// Else (ie. he entered a number between 0 and 10), create a variable named computerNumber where the value is a random number between 0 and 10 (Hint: Use the built-in Math.random() function). Make sure that the number is rounded.
